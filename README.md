![Dashboard](https://github.com/Anurag7215/Loan_Default_Risk_Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard.png)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Loan Default Risk using summary-level financial data.
The dataset contains aggregated metrics such as:

- Average Credit Score

- Average Loan Amount

- Average DTI Ratio

- Average Interest Rate

- Distinct Loan Count

The goal of this project is to understand borrower behavior, identify credit risk patterns, and generate meaningful insights that support financial decision-making.

## Objective of the Dashboard
The main objective of the dashboard is to:
- Measure overall loan portfolio health by tracking total loans, defaults, and average borrower metrics.
- Identify risk factors that influence defaults, such as credit score, DTI ratio, and income-loan balance.
- Compare borrower profiles (education, age, employment, marital status) to detect patterns in repayment behavior.
- Support lending decisions by highlighting which loan purposes and borrower segments carry higher risk.
- Enable interactive exploration with slicers, allowing managers to filter and analyze specific borrower groups.
