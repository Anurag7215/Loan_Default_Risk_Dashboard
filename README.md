# Loan Default Risk Analysis using Excel

![Dashboard](https://github.com/Anurag7215/Loan_Default_Risk_Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard.png)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Loan Default Risk using summary-level financial data.
The dataset contains aggregated metrics such as:

- Average Credit Score

- Average Loan Amount

- Average DTI Ratio

- Average Interest Rate

- Distinct Loan Count

The goal of this project is to understand borrower behavior, identify credit risk patterns, and generate meaningful insights that support financial decision-making.

## Objective of the Dashboard
**The main objective of the dashboard is to:**
- Measure overall loan portfolio health by tracking total loans, defaults, and average borrower metrics.
- Identify risk factors that influence defaults, such as credit score, DTI ratio, and income-loan balance.
- Compare borrower profiles (education, age, employment, marital status) to detect patterns in repayment behavior.
- Support lending decisions by highlighting which loan purposes and borrower segments carry higher risk.
- Enable interactive exploration with slicers, allowing managers to filter and analyze specific borrower groups.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Transformation

**Performed key operations to make the dataset analysis-ready:**

- Removed unnecessary or empty columns
- Handled missing values
- Extracted key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Reformatted summary tables into usable structures for analysis

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ **Credit Score Evaluation**

- Computed the average credit score of the dataset

- Compared credit score ranges to assess borrower risk

2️⃣ **Loan Amount Insight**

- Analyzed funding amount distribution

- Dentified high-value loan segments

3️⃣ **Risk Ratio Assessment**

- Reviewed DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio as a stress indicator

- Higher DTI suggests increased default probability

4️⃣ **Interest Rate Review**

- Evaluated the average interest rate charged

- Linked interest levels to credit quality
  
## 🔍 Key Insights

- Borrowers have low-to-moderate credit scores, signaling increased default risk.

- Average loan amount is relatively high, increasing financial exposure.

- The DTI ratio indicates heavy debt burden among applicants.

- High interest rates reflect the lender’s risk-reward strategy.

**These insights support underwriting teams and risk analysts in making informed lending decisions.**
